## Project Title

Disease Prediction Web Application using DSA Concepts

---

## Project Description

This project is a Python Flask–based web application developed as part of the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** course. The application allows users to select **symptoms** they are experiencing, and the system predicts the **probability of various diseases** the user may have. The project demonstrates the practical use of DSA for **efficient data handling, probability calculation, and algorithmic problem-solving** through an interactive web interface.
